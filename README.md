## About me.

**My name is Drake Alexander. I am based out of Oklahoma city, OK.** 

I have 3 girls, Rosabelle and Aubrey are twin 2 year olds and Abigail is 11. They take up 99% of my free time, the other 1% of my time is spent reading books. I have started to share my book reading time with time spent bettering myself with new skills such as coding as that is what I would like to eventually do for a living. I like to live quietly and am a homebody. 

## Purpose of this Website

This site is used to take the Code 102 course and beyond! Iâ€™ll be using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop my coding skills.
