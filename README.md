## About me.

**My name is Drake Alexander. I am based out of Oklahoma city, OK.** 

I have 3 girls, Rosabelle and Aubrey are twin 2 year olds and Abigail is 11. They take up 99% of my free time, the other 1% of my time is spent reading books. I have started to share my book reading time with time spent bettering myself with new skills such as coding as that is what I would like to eventually do for a living. I like to live quietly and am a homebody. 

## Purpose of this Website

`Markdown can be used for everything. Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application, Markdown is platform independent. Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. Markdown is everywhere.  `
