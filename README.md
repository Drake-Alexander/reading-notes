# My Reading Journal

#### My reading journal for Code Fellows.

[Github Portfolio Page](https://drake-alexander.github.io/reading-notes/)

**My name is Drake Alexander.** I have 3 girls, Rosabelle and Aubrey are twin 2 year olds and Abigail is 11. They are all girls. They take up 99% of my free time, the other 1% of my time is spent reading books. I have started to share my book reading time with time spent bettering myself with new skills such as coding as that is what I would like to eventually do for a living. I like to live quietly and am a homebody. 

`Growth Mindset is knowing that if I put time and effort into something, I can get good at it. That no one is born great at something, everyone developes the skill over time.`	

> I will remember that mistakes are part of the learning process.

> I know that I will get better with time and effort.

> When I get frustrated I will take a deep breath and try again.
