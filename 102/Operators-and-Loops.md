# Operators and Loops

### What is an expression in JavaScript?

A valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Here are a couple of examples x=9 and Z=3+5. 

### Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use a loop anytime we want the same action repeated multiple times. 

### When does a for loop stop executing?

When the specified condition evaluates to false.

### How many times will a while loop execute?

It executes for as long as its specified condition is true. It will terminate when the condition becomes false. If it never becomes false, the loop will never terminate. We do not want infinite loops though.
