### What is Version Control?

* Version control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control we can revert and/or compare changes. 

### What is cloning in Git?

* You copy all versions of all files for a project and place said copies in a new directory via a command.

### What is the command to track and stage files?

* git add * for all files or git add <filename>

### What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

* git commit -m  will commit the changes, meaning it sends to git hub as a snapshop of your changes. the -m means message so we can include why we made the changes.
