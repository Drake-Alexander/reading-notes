# Stretch-goals-for-102

I learned to be detail oriented within Ubuntu, forgetting anything in my command lines will cause issues that have to be worked through. Going back and double checking my command often results in succes. 

I also learned that using VCS is a whole lot more efficient than trying to create new pages within the github website. I enjoy the layout more and feel like I can navigate it easier.  

I really enjoyed this course.
