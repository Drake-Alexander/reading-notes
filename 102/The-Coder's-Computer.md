## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

      * The Code Completion feature provides suggestions when writing code to help you complete it faster and assists with accuracy so you have less errors or typos.

1. **Themes**

    * Themes allow you to change the background color, the text color, and sometimes other appearance aspects as well. This can reduce eye strain and fatigue. A popular choice is a dark background with brightly colored text.

* This command will show a list of the files in our current location. If you add the "-l" option then it will list them vertically making it easier to read.

### cd - Change directory

* This command allows you to change to a different directory, if you don't have any arguements, it takes you back to your home directory.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)


### cd projects

*  This would take you to the projects folder, this would be shown via the command "pwd". 

### mkdir new-project

*  This would make (make directory) a new file called "new-project"

### touch new-project/newfile.md

* This would create a new directory titled "new-project" and then within that directory it would create a file titled "newfile.md". 

### cd ..

* This would take us to the parent directory aka the previous folder.

### ls projects/new-project

* This would take us through the path of "projects" and "new-project and then list (ls) all of the files within the folder new-project.
