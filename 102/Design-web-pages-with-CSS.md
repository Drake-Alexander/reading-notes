# Design web pages with CSS

### What is the purpose of CSS?

` CSS is used for specifying how documents are presented to users. Generally this is used for styling the web page.`

### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

`External CSS: With an External style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file. Each html page must reference this file inside the head section. This sheet can be written in a text editor but must be saved with a .css extension and it should not contain any html tags.`

`Internal CSS: may be used if a single html page has a unique style. The internal style is defined by the <style> element inside of the head section. `

`Inline CSS: This is used when applying a unique style to a single element. You would add the <style> tag within the element itself.  `

### Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.


 P {
            color: red;
        }
