# 1.What is Growth Mindset?

 * Growth Mindset is knowing that if I put time and effort into something, I can get good at it. That no one is born great at something, everyone developes the skill over time.
 * Instead of thinking of all of the reasons we cannot do something, we think about way we can achieve our goals.
